"""Helper scripts for annotating Excel statistic sheets and renaming files.

This subpackage groups small utilities that either add contextual comments to
generated Excel workbooks or perform batch renaming tasks on point cloud files
and directories.  The modules are intended for command-line use and are kept
minimal, providing only the specific functionality required by the project.
