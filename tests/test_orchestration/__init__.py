"""Orchestration test suite.

This package contains tests that verify the orchestration layer's ability to
re-export and wrap core ``m3c2`` components without altering behaviour.

Notes
-----
Tests added here should focus on glue code and integrations that live in the
``orchestration`` package. Each test helps ensure that users can rely on the
orchestration layer as a thin wrapper around the core implementation.
