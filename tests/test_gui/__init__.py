"""GUI test suite.

This package exercises the project's Tkinter-based graphical utilities.

Notes
-----
The tests mock Tkinter widgets to run headless. They confirm that
``m3c2.gui.argparse_gui.run_gui`` collects user-provided values and
forwards them to both ``parse_args`` and a main callable when the
**Start** button is pressed.
