"""Common configuration building blocks for the M3C2 pipeline.

This module is intentionally lightweight and serves as a home for shared
configuration utilities or base classes that underpin the concrete
configuration dataclasses found in neighbouring modules.  Having a dedicated
module makes it easier to document and extend the configuration system in a
centralised place without introducing additional dependencies.
