"""Light-weight data structures used throughout the M3C2 core package.

The module acts as a central place for small container classes and type
aliases that are shared between different processing steps. Examples of
structures that belong here include representations of bounding boxes,
parameter estimation results, or outputs of outlier detection routines.
Keeping these definitions together helps to avoid circular imports and
provides a single reference point for the project.
